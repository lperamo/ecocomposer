# About EcoComposer

**EcoComposer** is a frontend library that will use as little *JavaScript* as possible.\
Most of the components are in pure *CSS*.\
They are created in *SASS* and are intended to generate as little code as possible for environmental performance purposes. \
It handles themes (light, dark) with the recent native browser feature of themes.

# Demo and documentation

The demo and documentation are available, for now, on the [official site](https://ecocomposer.otra.tech).
